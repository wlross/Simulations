# Simulations
This is some of my early interest in simulations.  The profit forecasting exercise was a fairly basic implementation of a simulation, while the Blackjack RL implementation is borrowed from R2D4 (classmate Matt Rickard) and used to explore how the hyperparameters of RL change results on a simple example of a card game using the Gym library form OpenAI.
